This document is a description of the scope language for claim requests.

The OAuth2 specification, in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3 and we quote

"The value of the scope parameter is expressed as a list of space-
    delimited, case-sensitive strings.  The strings are defined by the
    authorization server.  If the value contains multiple space-delimited
    strings, their order does not matter, and each string adds an
    additional access range to the requested scope."

There is more in section 3.3, but the relevant point for us is that these are defined on the server and are interpreted
    there, so we have a free hand in specifying them. The aim is to make a small claims language that in
    effect allows each scope to be a specific request and be processed. This includes parameters for the
    request.

The most natural syntax will be a uri with various bits for a query. The query parameters are simply the
mutable parts, e.g.

scitokens:access:/read?path=/foo/bar/baz&location=https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/

so scitokens -- scopes it
access -- what is requested
various parameters relating to the request.
